# Tri-Ad_Data-Science-Challenge

## Goal
You will be provided with a data set about students. The data set includes
information about the studentsâ€™ age, nationality, gender, as well as information
about their studying habits. There is also a binary column expressing whether or not
the students passed an important test.

## Part 1: Analysis
- Describe the demographic details of people most likely to pass the test
- Describe the efficacy of the two interventions - the test prep course and the
Dojo class
- Identify any other interesting trends from the data set and offer some analysis
as to their importance or cause.

## Part 2: Model Creation
Create a model that can predict whether or not a student will pass the test. Use the
provided data set to train your model and test its accuracy. You have free choice of
programming language, algorithm, and tools.
